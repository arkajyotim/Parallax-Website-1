      <h2>What is Parallax Effect?</h2>
      <p>
        Parallax effect is a design technique used in websites where the background of a webpage moves at a different speed than the rest of the content. This creates an illusion of depth and gives the website a 3D effect, making it more visually engaging and interactive. The parallax effect is achieved by using multiple layers of images or elements that move at different speeds as the user scrolls down the page. For example, the background image may move slower than the foreground content, or the background may stay fixed while the foreground elements move. The parallax effect can be used to create a variety of effects, such as a subtle scrolling effect that adds depth to the page, or a more dramatic effect that creates a sense of motion and animation. Overall, the parallax effect is a popular design technique that can enhance the visual appeal and user experience of a website.

      <h2>Forest</h2>
      <p>
        A forest is a large area of land covered with trees, underbrush, and other vegetation. Forests are important for the health of the planet, as they provide essential ecosystem services such as oxygen production, carbon sequestration, and habitat for countless species of plants and animals. They also help regulate the climate and prevent soil erosion. Forests come in many different types, from temperate and tropical rainforests to coniferous and deciduous forests. They can be found all around the world, and have been the subject of many cultural, spiritual, and artistic traditions throughout human history. Despite their importance, many forests are under threat due to deforestation, climate change, and other human activities, making conservation efforts more important than ever.
